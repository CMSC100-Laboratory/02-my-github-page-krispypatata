### Steps on How to Create a GitHub Page
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (typically named `<GitHub Username>.github.io`).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Add an `index.html` file to your local repository.
4. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
5. Configure the visibility settings of your repository, changing it to public.
6. Go to the Pages section in the repository settings.
7. Under the Branch section, select the branch where you stored your `index.html` and save the changes.
8. Visit `https://<GitHub Username>.github.io` to see your GitHub Page live.

### Takeaways
- Experimenting with Flexbox has been a lot of fun as it was useful for efficiently managing layouts. However, I noticed that I had forgotten many HTML and CSS basics, so I had to review and relearn them online. Although it was challenging, working on CSS design was really enjoyable as it showed me the importance of practice and patience in learning web development skills.
